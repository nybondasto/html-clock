Seasonal Digital Clock 1.0:n technical documentation
===================================================================================

17.10.2018/Tomas Nybondas


Seasonal Digital Clock is created just by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
All logic is found in the index.html-file.

Moment.JS is used for easy formatting of the clock display. If you need to change
the time format, please check Moment.JS documentation on their website.

CSS-styles are written on that same page, because they are so few and I didn't
want to have an css-stylesheet, that would be loaded on page load.
Seasonal background images are located by season and in respective folders.

Height of the images should be 800px minimum, so that display looks nice and cool.
The logo located in the top left corner is a PNG-image with transparent background,  
that is placed with css-style as an overlay over the top of the background. Thus
logo keeps always its dimensions even when background resizes. Running clock display
is also an overlay and it is just plain text with css-style.

Javascript-function showTime() updates clock once a second - nothing fancy here...

If you make changes to index.html-file, you have to upload the file back to the webserver
(if you use one) to take effect. If new background-images are added, they also needs to be 
uploaded to the webserver.
